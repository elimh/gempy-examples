# gempy-examples
Workflows to conduct stochastic simulations of models in [GemPy](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy) and to visualize the results. All demonstrated on a simple example model with three different lithologies and one fault. Relatively old code, documentation is lacking. Feel free to add explanations to make these notebooks useful for anyone starting to work with stochastic simulations in GemPy.

**Important note:** It is not guaranteed that these notebooks will run with the main version of gempy. Gempy is in active development and things are changing fast, which can lead to errors when running code in these notebooks. However, the code will always run with [this fork of gempy](https://github.com/elimh/gempy).
